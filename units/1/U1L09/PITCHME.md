## Protocol Poster

With your group, create an *efficient* binary protocol for playing a three-person game of Battleship on a 3x3 board over the Internet simulator.

Efficient means the smallest number of bits that:

* Allows you to play the game accurately.
* Send the necessary messages.

What messages do you need to send? What could go wrong?
