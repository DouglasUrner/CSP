This assignment helps me to gather information about you and the skills that you are bringing to our class. I'd like to know:

* How comfortable you are working with electronic documents.
* How easy it is for you to follow instructions and learn new routines.
* How comfortably you can express yourself in writing.

**So,** for this assignment ***everyone*** in the group should be completing the activity guide (as well as taking notes and helping to create the poster).
