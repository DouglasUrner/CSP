The first thing to do is to get your "filing system" organized. Set up folders for the class on the **U:** drive and on Google Drive. Create:
* **U:\2019-2020\CSP\Unit 1**
* And a similar folder on Google Drive.

Then make a copy of the
[Activity Guide - Personal Innovations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UnhtzSXXEQSDsza2UbuA6LmWVM-e4FRd9qX4oEt9PF8/edit?usp=sharing).
When you first open it, you will not be able to edit the document. Here's what to do:
1. From the document **File** menu choose **Make a copy** (File > Make a copy)
1. The file name will default to:
    ***Copy of U1L01 Activity Guide - Personal Innovations***.
    Change it to:
    ***Lastname, Firstname - U1L01 Activity Guide - Personal Innovations***
1. Change the folder to the "CSP/Unit 1" folder that you created on your Google Drive.
1. Click the OK button.

This assignment helps me to gather information about you and the skills that you are bringing to our class. I'd like to know:

* How comfortable you are working with electronic documents.
* How easy it is for you to follow instructions and learn new routines.
* How comfortably you can express yourself in writing.

**So,** for this assignment ***everyone*** in the group should be completing the activity guide (as well as taking notes and helping to create the poster).

After you have completed your activity guide, submit it through Canvas. The easiest way to submit online documents in through the Google Docs file picker - be sure to follow along when I demonstrate how to set it up and use it.
