## Challenge:

Develop a *protocol* or set of rules for communicating a simple drawing to your partners using only numbers - then demonstrate that it works using the [Internet Simulator][codestudio].

### Challenge Rules:
<img src="assets/1.06-example-image.PNG" align="right">

* The image will be a line drawing created by connecting points on a grid, like the one seen here.
* You can discuss and agree on a protocol ahead of time, but the image exchange must happen without communication between the two parties other than through using the Internet Simulator.
* You can only send a single message - a single list of numbers - through the Internet Simulator to describe the whole image.

### Things to Consider:
* How will your points be formatted?
* How does the recipient know when one number ends and the next begins?

### Your Protocol:

Use your notebook to brainstorm ideas and then write down the steps in your protocol.

## Check Your Understanding

After developing and testing your protocol, complete the *Check your understanding* questions.
