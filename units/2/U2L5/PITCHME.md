### Warm Up:

From Unit 2 Lesson 5 on Code.org go to the **Lossy Text Compression App**.

With a partner - experiment with the app for a bit and discuss what is happening, then answer the questions in your notes:

* Should this “count” as text compression? Why or why not?
* What do you think the word “lossy” refers to?
* What makes it work? Or not work...
