### Warm Up:

From Unit 2 Lesson 5 on Code.org go to the **Lossy Text Compression App**.

With a partner - experiment with the app for a bit and discuss what is happening, then answer the questions in your notes:

* Should this “count” as text compression? Why or why not?
* What do you think the word “lossy” refers to?
* What makes it work? Or not work...

### Vocabulary

* **Lossless Compression:** a data compression algorithm that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.
* **Lossy Compression:** (or irreversible compression) a data compression method that uses inexact approximations, discarding some data to represent the content. Most commonly seen in image formats like .jpg.

When you use lossy compression you lose the ability to decompress your information and get back a perfect copy. Even so, people use lossy compression all the time. Can you think of reasons or situations where someone would still use lossy compression?
