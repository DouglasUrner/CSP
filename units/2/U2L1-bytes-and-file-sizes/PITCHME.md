## Warm Up

In addition to the text of a document, we can store formatting information. How much extra information – how many extra bytes, do we need to include formatting?

A single ASCII character is one byte so, to store “hello” in a plain ASCII file, we would need 5 bytes.

What about a Word document that contains the single word "hello"? How many more bytes will it need to store “hello”?
