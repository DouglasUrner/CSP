## Warm Up

In addition to the text of a document, we can store formatting information. How much extra information – how many extra bytes, does this add?

A single ASCII character is one byte so, to store “hello” in a plain ASCII file, we would need 5 bytes.

What if we store "hello" in a Word document? How many more bytes will be needed?
