## Warm Up

In addition to the actual text of a document, we often store formatting information so that text is displayed correctly. How much extra information, i.e. how many extra bytes, do we need to store when we include formatting?

A single ASCII character is one byte so, to store the word “hello” in a plain ASCII file, we would expect to need 5 bytes.

What about a Microsoft Word document that contains the single word "hello"? How many more bytes will Word need to store the word “hello”?
